<p>	
  I am Xinbiao Liu and I am a freshman in college at the university of Missouri! My parents own a restaraurant back home that is a Chinese buffet service. I have a younger brother that is a freshman in high school and is a sports person that is into football. My interests include watching shows, swimming, TV, designing things. and even reading books. The books I mostly read are manga because they have pictures and words that tell a story. My favorite manga include Junji Ito, Demon Slayer, and much more! The tvs shows I love the most include anime, Squid Game, Spongebob Squarepants, and Phineas and Ferb. My other favorite series include PVZ, Touhou, and Roblox. 
  
  I was a part of DECA and did Robotics for FTC back at high school. DECA was part of what I did in high school for all 4 years because I am interested in marketing and completed in events which involves us talking about our project.

I was a member of culinary arts for high school which involves cooking dishes from scratch and I got my certificate from culinary arts.

I graduated high school class of 2025. 
My degree is into educational studies: educational games and simulation design and international business at the University of Missouri.</p>
