    <p>
      Hello, I am <strong>Xinbiao Liu</strong>! My purpose is to build a career that combines creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork while making a meaningful impact on others. 
      So I created a portfolio about myself and my goals! Growing up working in my family’s restaurant, I gained early experience in responsibility, adaptability, and customer service. 
      Those lessons taught me the value of hard work and staying reliable under pressure. In high school, I was a member of DECA, which gave me opportunities to strengthen my leadership, 
      communication, and business skills through teamwork and competitive events. These experiences inspired me to think more deeply about how people learn, connect, and grow in both 
      professional and educational settings. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Educational Studies with a focus on Educational Games and Simulation Design at the University of Missouri. 
      My long-term goal is to apply my knowledge and skills to develop innovative educational tools and experiences that make learning more interactive, engaging, and accessible for everyone.
