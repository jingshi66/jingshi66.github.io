      <h1>My Reflection</h1>
      <p>I see my time at Mizzou as an opportunity to grow both personally and professionally while exploring different career paths. To me, college is more than just a place to earn a degree—it’s a chance to discover who I am, what inspires me, and how I can make a positive impact on the world around me. I want to use this experience not only to gain knowledge in the classroom but also to build meaningful relationships, challenge myself, and learn from the diverse community that defines Mizzou. With so many opportunities to engage, create, and lead, I’m eager to make the most of everything the university has to offer.

One of my greatest passions is combining creativity with technology, which is why I am especially drawn to the field of video game design. Video games blend art, storytelling, and innovation in a way that allows people to experience entirely new worlds. I’m fascinated by the idea of crafting characters, stories, and environments that players can connect with, and I see game design as a way to bring imagination to life. The creative process also involves collaboration, critical thinking, and experimentation—skills that I am excited to strengthen through my studies and projects at Mizzou.

At the same time, I understand that technology’s influence extends far beyond entertainment. It shapes how we communicate, solve problems, and improve lives across industries like healthcare, education, and business. That’s why I want to explore how technology can be applied in broader, real-world contexts. I’m also interested in international business because it fosters cross-cultural understanding and prepares people to work in a globalized world. Learning how to bridge cultures and ideas is something I value deeply, and I believe it will help me think more broadly about the impact of my future work.

By taking advantage of Mizzou’s resources, programs, and community, I hope to challenge myself and uncover my full potential. Whether through clubs, internships, or creative collaborations, I want to gain hands-on experience that prepares me for a career combining innovation and purpose. My goal is not only to succeed professionally but also to create something meaningful that inspires and helps others. I believe Mizzou is the ideal place to begin that journey—a place where I can grow, explore, and become the best version of myself.
