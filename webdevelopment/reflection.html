      <h1>My Reflection</h1>
      <p>I see my time at Mizzou as an opportunity to grow both personally and professionally while exploring different career paths. College is more than just earning a degree—it is a chance to discover who I am, what excites me, and how I can contribute to the world around me. I want to use this experience not only to gain knowledge in the classroom but also to build relationships, step outside my comfort zone, and learn from the diverse community I will be surrounded by. Mizzou offers countless opportunities to do this, and I am eager to take advantage of them.
One of my biggest passions is creativity paired with technology, which is why I am especially drawn to becoming a video game designer. Video games combine art, storytelling, and innovation in a way that allows people to experience worlds beyond their own. I am fascinated by the idea of building characters, stories, and environments that players can interact with, and I see this field as a place where I can bring imagination to life. The process of designing games also requires teamwork, problem-solving, and constant experimentation—skills that I am excited to develop further during my time at Mizzou.
At the same time, I recognize that technology plays a much larger role in shaping our future than just entertainment. From innovative design to solving global challenges, technology can open new doors in industries like healthcare, education, and business. That is why I also want to explore courses and opportunities that will help me understand how technology can be applied in different contexts. Another area that sparks my interest is international business, because it allows people to connect across cultures, expand their perspectives, and prepare for careers that are not limited by borders. In today’s interconnected world, these skills are more important than ever.
By taking advantage of the resources, programs, and community at Mizzou, I hope to challenge myself and discover my true strengths. Whether through clubs, internships, or academic projects, I want to gain hands-on experience that prepares me for a career that combines my passions with meaningful impact. My goal is not only to succeed in a chosen field but also to create something that can inspire and help others. Ultimately, I see Mizzou as the perfect place to begin that journey, as it offers the support, opportunities, and experiences I need to grow into the best version of myself.
